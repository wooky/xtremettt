A simple tic-tac-toe game that I somehow managed to make in around 12 hours straight. Obviously I have no life.

Supports the following game types:
 * Human: you place your mark using the mouse
 * Random: randomly places a mark
 * Blocking: detects if you're going to win and stops you right there
 * Smart: detects if it's going to win and places its mark right there
 * jon: the best mode, the most pants-on-head-retardation you have ever seen - detects if it's going to win or block you somewhere and completely ignores that spot. ye

To run this "game", you'll need Python (version 2) and Pygame (the latest). You can also download a compiled version for Windows by clinking on the [releases](https://github.com/wooky/xtremettt/releases)
