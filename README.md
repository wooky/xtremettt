A simple tic-tac-toe game that I somehow managed to make in around 12 hours straight. Obviously I have no life.

Supports the following game types:
 * Human: you place your mark using the mouse
 * Random: randomly places a mark
 * Blocking: detects if you're going to win and stops you right there
 * Smart: detects if it's going to win and places its mark right there
 * jon: the best mode, the most pants-on-head-retardation you have ever seen - detects if it's going to win or block you somewhere and completely ignores that spot. ye

To run this "game", you'll need Python (version 2), Pygame (1.9.2+ - get it from [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads); choose the py2.7 version), and VideoCapture if you're on Windows (follow instructions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17208890)). You can also download a compiled version for Windows by clinking on the [releases](https://github.com/wooky/xtremettt/releases)
